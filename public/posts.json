    "intro": "React was introduced in May 2013. Its paradigm shift was that your UI was a function of your state. Given some component state, React can determine what your component will look like. React is built upon the idea of state. However, state has long been one of the most difficult parts of building a React application.",

    "intro": "Modern JavaScript frameworks are all about reactivity. Change your application's state, and the view updates automatically. But there's a catch — tracking state changes at runtime adds overhead that eats into your bundle size and performance budgets. In this talk, we'll discover an alternative approach: moving reactivity into the language itself. Your apps have never been smaller or faster than they're about to become.",
